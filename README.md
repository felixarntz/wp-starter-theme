Post Types Definitely
=====================

This framework plugin makes adding post types with taxonomies and meta to WordPress very simple, yet flexible. It all works using a single action and an array.

You can download the latest version from the [WordPress plugin repository](http://wordpress.org/plugins/post-types-definitely/). If you prefer to install it from Github, make sure to run `composer install` before using it in order to download the necessary dependencies.

For a detailed guide and reference on how to use this framework, please read the [Wiki on Github](https://github.com/felixarntz/post-types-definitely/wiki). Once you get familiar with the options you have, you will be able to create complex post type interfaces with taxonomies and meta fields in just a few minutes.

Contributions and Bugs
----------------------

If you have ideas on how to improve the plugin or if you discover a bug, I would appreciate if you shared them with me, right here on Github. In either case, please open a new issue [here](https://github.com/felixarntz/post-types-definitely/issues/new)!

You can also contribute to the plugin by translating it. Among the plugin files, there is a `.pot` file which you can use as a starting point. When you're done with a translation, you can either create a pull request with the new translation files or you can send them to me manually. Note that you can help not only translating the plugin, but also the underlying library [_WPDLib_](https://github.com/felixarntz/wpdlib).
